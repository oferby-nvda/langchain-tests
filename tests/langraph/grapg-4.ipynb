It costs less than the additional item of baggage.\\n\\nWith the Economy Light fare, how can I purchase a 1 st bag (max. 23 kg) in addition?\\nThe first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport.
